5683,Nina Edelweiss,Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul - UFRGS,TVX - Time and Versions in XML,"The proposed work explores the application of temporal and versioning management techniques to the content of XML documents. Recently, many methods have been proposed to address this problem. These methods differ in many aspects, such as which XML objects should be temporalized, thus possessing each one a set of advantages and limitations. We present the TVX model, whose goal is to combine these techniques into a single approach its united use should supply great flexibility in the temporal treatment of XML documents. This will be accomplished through a high-level data model which can be easily implemented in XML format, along with XQuery-like query and data manipulation languages to handle the temporal XML documents.

In this work we propose an efficient and accurate methodology for the statistical modeling of circuits. Error propagation and numerical techniques are applied for electrical-level modeling of random and systematic variations during the manufacturing process. The model considers covariances between parameters and spatial correlation, and has as output statistical estimators that can be used in higher-level tools, such as statistical delay analysis (SSTA) tools. Furthermore, we developed a methodology for the quantitative analysis of the contribution of each parameter to the variance of the circuit response. As case studies, we model the yield of a SRAM memory and a dynamic precharge NOR gate. In the first, we consider the impact of channel length and threshold voltage on SRAM memory cell access time. We develop a probabilistic model for the delay of a dynamic NOR with static keeper, considering variations in channel width and threshold voltage. We compared the results calculated by the proposed methodology with statistical data obtained from Monte Carlo simulations.

5962,Siome Klein Goldenstein,Universidade Estadual de Campinas - Unicamp,A Gentle Introduction to Predictive Filters,"Predictive filters are essential tools in modern science. They perform state prediction and parameter estimation in fields such as robotics, computer vision, and computer graphics. Sometimes also called Bayesian filters, they apply the Bayesian rule of conditional probability to combine a predicted behavior with some corrupted indirect observation. When we study and solve a problem, we first need its proper mathematical formulation. Finding the essential parameters that best describe the system is hard modeling their behaviors over time is even more challenging. Usually, we also have an inspection mechanism that provides us with indirect measurements, the observations, of the hidden underlying parameters. We also need to deal with the concept of uncertainty, and use random variables to represent both the state and the observations. Predictive filters are a family of estimation techniques. They combine the uncertain prediction from the system’s dynamics and the corrupted observation. There are many different predictive filters, each dealing with different types of mathematical representations for random variables and system dynamics. Here, the reader will find a dense introduction to predictive filters. After a general introduction, we discuss briefly discussion about mathematical modeling of systems: state representation, dynamics, and observation. Then, we expose some basic issues related to random variables and uncertainty modeling, and discuss four implementations of predictive filters, in order of complexity: the Kalman filter, the extended Kalman filter, the particle filter, and the unscented Kalman filter.Keywords: Predictive Filters, Density Estimators, Kalman Filter, Particle Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter.",,pt_BR,Published,29,2008,2008-09-18 23:30:33,Brazil,Campinas,-229.056.391,-47.059.564,9225

5964,Jörn Loviscach,Universidade de Bremen,Shader Programming: An Introduction Using the Effect Framework,"Current commodity graphics cards offer programmability through vertex shaders and pixel shaders to create special effects by deformation, lighting, texturing, etc. The Effect framework introduced by Microsoft allows to store shader program code, settings, and a limited graphical user interface within a single .fx text file. This supports a division of labor between programmers writing the code and designers using the GUI elements to control settings. Furthermore, the Effect framework proves to be ideal for experimenting with shader programming — be it for learning purposes or for rapid prototyping. In this tutorial, we employ the Effect framework for an exploratory, hands-on approach, introducing first principles only as needed, not in advance. Simple shader programs are used to review basic 3D techniques such as homogeneous coordinates and the Phong shading model. Then we turn to basic deformation effects employing vertex shaders and the use of texture maps as decals or reflected environments inside pixel shaders. To create bump mapping and related effects, tangent space coordinates and normal maps are introduced. Finally, we treat more complex effects such as anisotropic specular highlights.Keywords: Pixel shader, Vertex shader, HLSL, Effect framework",,pt_BR,Published,39,2008,2008-09-18 23:40:07,Brazil,Bremen,530.758.196,88.071.646,2496

This expansion has accelerated with the development of efficient schemes dedicated to image compression. Nowadays, the image creation process relies on multidimensional objects generated from computer aided design, physical simulations, data representation or optimisation problem solutions. This variety of sources motivates the design of compression schemes adapted to specific class of models. The recent launch of Google Sketch’up and its 3D models warehouse has accelerated the shift from two-dimensional images to three-dimensional ones. However, these kind of systems require fast access to eventually huge models, which is possible only through the use of efficient compression schemes.

In relation to other approaches for recovering the 3D geometry of electric arcs, the model proposed here is independent of the determination of homologous points and a specific positioning of cameras, in addition to providing tracking of the electric arc, taking into account the temporal dependence between consecutive pairs of frames in two videos. For evaluation purposes, experiments were carried out on synthetic images obtained from the simulation of an image acquisition system, as well as experiments with images of real electric arcs produced at CEPEL. The results obtained were considered acceptable, demonstrating the potential of the presented approach.",,pt_BR,Published,1,2010,2010-03-08 15:06:56,Brazil,Porto Alegre,-300.324.999,-512.303.767,1232

From 2004 onwards, we increased our efforts to increase RITA's visibility. In these two decades, technology and the culture of access to Journals have changed. The CAPES Digital Library has opened a new perspective of digital access, with students and researchers in Computer Science developing a new culture of access to these resources. From 2010 onwards we will publish three issues exclusively digitally, taking into account the global trend that indicates that electronic journals are the most accessed and read by the academic community.

Currently, Automatic Document Image Recognition Systems are used to automatically convert the information contained in images into editable text, quickly and without the need for an individual to be present. Thus, making this information searchable through, for example, keywords. Slanting in documents is a frequent problem in these systems and, in general, is  imposed during scanning, when the paper is positioned at an angle other than zero degrees on the scanner axis. In the case of handwritten documents, slant can appear while writing the document itself, especially when the writer does not have an agenda line as a guide. Tilt correction is essential for the good performance of automatic recognition systems.

Besides the automatic translation and precise definition of the mapping, the use of a formal language also allowed the verification of the existence and uniqueness of the out coming model. ",,pt_BR,Published,20,2012,2012-01-24 21:27:33,Brazil,Uberlandia,-189.188.041,-482.767.837,1764

This work presents a reinforcement learning based approach for route choicewhich relies solely on drivers experience to guide their decisions. There is no coordinatedlearning mechanism, thus driver agents are independent learners. Our approachis tested on two abstract traffic scenarios and it is compared to other route choice methods.Experimental results show that drivers learn routes in complex scenarios with noprior knowledge. Plus, the approach outperforms the compared route choice methodsregarding drivers’ travel time. Also, satisfactory performance is achieved regardingroad network load balance.

Our proposal is based on text-retrieval methods in which video key frames are represented by a dense set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors that enable recognition to proceed successfully despite changes in camera viewpoint, lighting, and partial occlusions. Vector quantizing these region descriptors provides a visual analogy of a word - a visual word. Those words are grouped into a visual vocabulary which is used to index all key frames from the video database. Efficient retrieval is then achieved by employing methods from statistical text retrieval, including inverted file systems, and text-document frequency weightings. Though works in the literature have only adopted a simple sequential scan during search, we investigate the use of different metric access methods (MAM): M-tree, Slim-tree, and D-index, in order to accelerate the processing of similarity queries. In addition, a ranking strategy based on the spatial layout of the regions (spatial consistency) is fully described and evaluated. Experimental results have shown that the adoption of MAMs not only has improved the search performance but also has reduced the influence of the vocabulary size over test results, which may improve the scalability of our proposal.

51756,Michele Rorato Sagrillo,Universidade Franciscana - UFN,Deconvolução Cega Aplicada à Correção de Artefatos de Movimento em Imagens de Vídeo de Microscopia Intravital para Detecção Automática de Leucócitos,"Intravital microscopy (IM) is a powerful tool used in the biomedical field for the in vivo observation and imaging of biological systems, having an important application in the study of leukocyte-endothelium interactions that occur in the microcirculation of various animal tissues under normal and pathological conditions. Given that the control of image acquisition conditions in in vivo analysis is quite limited, the presence of blur and motion artifacts in the acquired video frame sequences, resulting from the animal's inevitable breathing and heartbeat, constitutes one of the main MI obstacles. This significantly compromises the detection and tracking of leukocytes throughout the frames, both in visual analyzes and those carried out by automatic (computational) methods. Thus, this work carried out the study and application of two blind deconvolution techniques (deconvblind algorithm and Shan et al. method) for the correction of motion artifacts in MI video images, making a quantitative assessment of how such restoration affects the performance of two automatic leukocyte detection methods (pattern matching and local phase symmetry). Precision versus recall analyzes were conducted in order to evaluate the effectiveness of automatic detection in images of good visual quality, images degraded by motion and images restored with each technique.

This initiative is due to the existence of the problem of verifying the use of operationalizations of this type of requirement in the software built. In this work we present a method, with support techniques and tools, that check whether software complies with RNF standards established in the catalog as an alternative to the RNF verification problem. Verification is an analysis technique that does not require the execution of the software, that is, the demonstration of its behavior. The term verification is used in contrast to the term validation. The spectrum of verification ranges from testing programs against specifications in a more formal sense, to visual inspection of programs in a less formal sense. The adopted strategy uses autonomous agents to verify software conformity in relation to RNF operationalizations, for this purpose it uses a knowledge base of patterns persisted in a catalog. The partial results are indicative that the proposed solution is applicable. Validity assessment takes place by demonstrating that a partially automated method is effective in identifying conformities. A difference in the proposal is that, in general, the work focused on verification is strongly focused on the functional vision, while the solution presented here is innovative in linking the RNF to its effective implementation. As a proof of concept, an RNF pattern technique based on goal orientation was applied and customized in case studies of examples from everyday software practice. As well as the construction of a framework of agents, which operate under XML notations, to identify software conformities in relation to an RNF catalog.",,pt_BR,Published,32,2015,2015-06-12 02:50:40,Brazil,Belo Horizonte,-199.227.318,-439.450.948,1310

We examine the specific constraints and pitfalls found in each of the key stages of the model development framework, namely data collection, design and evaluation, and discuss alternatives to enhance the effectiveness of the entire process. Although predictive material appearance models developed by computer graphics  researchers are usually aimed at realistic image synthesis applications, they  also provide valuable support for a myriad of advanced investigations in related areas,  such as computer vision, image processing and pattern recognition,  which rely on the accurate analysis and interpretation of material appearance attributes in the hyperspectral domain. In fact, their scope of contributions goes beyond the realm of traditional computer science applications. For example, predictive light transport simulations, which are essential for the development of these models, are also regularly beingused by physical and life science researchers to understand andpredict material appearance changes prompted by mechanisms which cannot be fully studied using standard ``wet'' experimental procedures.For completeness, this tutorial also provides an overview of such synergistic research efforts and in silico investigations, which are illustrated by case studies involving the use of hyperspectral material appearance  models.",,pt_BR,Published,30,2015,2015-06-16 23:31:35,Brazil,Sao Paulo,-235.506.507,-466.333.824,1241

Furthermore, the impact of the size of the training set on the processing time and accuracy of the gender classifier was investigated. The conclusions of this work indicate that men and women vary their attention depending on the type of content. Additionally, the increase in the size of the training set (from a certain value) has no influence on the accuracy of the gender classifier, but it does have an influence on the increase in processing time.",,en_US,Published,28,2015,2015-10-04 22:29:39,Brazil,Sao Paulo,-235.506.507,-466.333.824,1154

In addition, we also investigate some well-known subtopic segmentation and clustering techniques in order to correctly select the most relevant information to compose the final summary.

69309,Adriano Fiorese,Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina - UDESC,Non-Cooperative Facility Location Games: a Survey,"The Facility Location problem is a well-know NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problem. It models a diverse set of situations where one aims to provide a set of goods or services via a set of facilities F to a set of clients T, also called terminals. There are opening costs for each facility in F and connection costs for each pair of facility and client, if such facility attends this client. A central authority wants to determine the solution with minimum cost, considering both opening and connection costs, in such a way that all clients are attended by one facility. In this survey we are interested in the non-cooperative game version of this problem, where instead of having a central authority, each client is a player and decides where to con- nect himself. In doing so, he aims to minimize his own costs, given by the connection costs and opening costs of the facility, which may be shared among clients using the same facility. This problem has several applications as well, specially in distributed scenarios where a central authority is too expensive or even infeasible to exist. In this paper we present a survey describing different variants of this problem and reviewing several results about it, as well as adapting results from existing literature concerning the existence of equilibria, Price of Anarchy and Price of Stability. We also point out open problems that remain to be addressed. ",,pt_BR,Published,29,2016,2016-11-08 19:48:06,Brazil,Florianopolis,-275.973.002,-485.496.098,1756

Several tasks were identified as impossible for machines and later conquered by new advances in Artificial Intelligence. Nowadays, it seems that we are not far from the day when driving cars will be included in the tasks that machines can do efficiently. Certainly, even more complex activities will be dominated by machines in the future. In this article, we argue that investment analysis, the process of evaluating and selecting investments in terms of risk and return, may be among the tasks performed efficiently by machines in the perhaps not distant future. In fact, there are significant research efforts to create algorithms and quantitative methods for analyzing investments. We present a brief review about them. Through this review, we can see that there are many challenges and complexities to be faced in the pursuit of autonomous investment analysis (AAI). In this article, we propose an approach to simplify the problem of autonomous investment analysis capable of dealing with the identified complexities (nature of assets, multiple analysis algorithms per asset, non-stationarity and multiple investment horizons). This approach is based on the simultaneous use of several autonomous agents and the discretization of the AAI problem and its modeling as a classification problem. This approach breaks down the complexity faced by AAI into problems that can be addressed by a group of agents working together to provide intelligent, personalized investment advice to individuals.

79310,Francisco Oliveira,Universidade Federal de Pernambuco - UFPE,A Genetic Programming Model for Association Studies to Detect Epistasis in Low Heritability Data,"The genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) aims to identify the most influential markers in relation to the phenotype values. One of the substantial challenges is to find a non-linear mapping between genotype and phenotype, also known as epistasis, that usually becomes the process of searching and identifying functional SNPs more complex. Some diseases such as cervical cancer, leukemia and type 2 diabetes have low heritability. The heritability of the sample is directly related to the explanation defined by the genotype, so the lower the heritability the greater the influence of the environmental factors and the less the genotypic explanation. In this work, an algorithm capable of identifying epistatic associations at different levels of heritability is proposed. The developing model is a aplication of genetic programming with a specialized initialization for the initial population consisting of a random forest strategy. The initialization process aims to rank the most important SNPs increasing the probability of their insertion in the initial population of the genetic programming model. The expected behavior of the presented model for the obtainment of the causal markers intends to be robust in relation to the heritability level. The simulated experiments are case-control type with heritability level of 0.4, 0.3, 0.2 and 0.1 considering scenarios with 100 and 1000 markers.

One of the substantial challenges is to find a non-linear mapping between genotype and phenotype, also known as epistasis, that usually becomes the process of searching and identifying functional SNPs more complex. Some diseases such as cervical cancer, leukemia and type 2 diabetes have low heritability. The heritability of the sample is directly related to the explanation defined by the genotype, so the lower the heritability the greater the influence of the environmental factors and the less the genotypic explanation. In this work, an algorithm capable of identifying epistatic associations at different levels of heritability is proposed. The developing model is a aplication of genetic programming with a specialized initialization for the initial population consisting of a random forest strategy. The initialization process aims to rank the most important SNPs increasing the probability of their insertion in the initial population of the genetic programming model. The expected behavior of the presented model for the obtainment of the causal markers intends to be robust in relation to the heritability level. The simulated experiments are case-control type with heritability level of 0.4, 0.3, 0.2 and 0.1 considering scenarios with 100 and 1000 markers.

There are plenty of studies focused on mobility in mobile wireless networks, including the proposals of several synthetic mobility models. Getting real mobility traces is not an easy task, but there has been some efforts to provide traces to the public through repositories. Synthetic mobility models are usually analyzed through mobility metrics, which are designed to capture mobility subtleties. This work research on the applicability of some representative mobility metrics for real traces analysis.

For example, theoretical predictions lead to an adequate neuron model choice. To make such theoretical predictions, the cortical circuit simulations are carried out in amplitude mode. Differently from the spike mode, in amplitude mode information is represented by sequences of scalar values that describe neural input and output spike rates. In this paper, it was proposed amplitude and spike mode simulations of a cortical algorithm, namely the diffusive filling-in algorithm, to investigate whether predictions based on the amplitude-mode results approximate well the behavior of the customized hardware (spike mode results). The diffusive filling-in algorithm was chosen because it is simple enough for spike-mode simulation in a conventional computer, but the proposed amplitude-mode prediction method is the same for more complex algorithms or circuits. We provide a highly realistic comparison between amplitude-mode and spike-mode in the diffusive filling-in case, which suggests that the amplitude mode is reliable for theoretical predictions useful for customized hardware design for cortical circuit simulation.

Algorithms used to accomplish these tasks simultaneously cluster objects and attributes, enabling the discovery of biclusters or coclusters.

An accurate study on algorithms related to biclustering and coclustering is essential to achieve effectiveness when solving real-world problems.

In these domains, large amounts of data are constantly arriving over time, possibly at high speed. The proposed algorithm uses a top-down induction method for building trees, splitting leaf nodes recursively, until none of them can be expanded. The new algorithm combines two split methods in the tree induction. The first method is able to guarantee, with statistical significance, that each split chosen would be the same as that chosen using infinite examples. By doing so, it aims at ensuring that the tree induced online is close to the optimal model. However, this split method often needs too many examples to make a decision about the best split, which delays the accuracy improvement of the online predictive learning model. Therefore, the second method is used to split nodes more quickly, speeding up the tree growth. The second split method is based on the observation that larger trees are able to store more information about the training examples and to represent more complex concepts. The first split method is also used to correct splits previously suggested by the second one, when it has sufficient evidence. Finally, an additional procedure rebuilds the tree model according to the suggestions made with an adequate level of statistical significance. The proposed algorithm is empirically compared with several well-known induction algorithms for learning decision trees from data streams.

Therefore, a Fortran language computational program called HICOLM was developed, whose theoretical bases are based on two commonly known models (Tight-binding and Molecular Dynamics). The physical properties of condensed systems can be obtained in the thermodynamic equilibrium in several statistical ensembles, and possible to obtain an analysis of the properties of the material and its evolution in the time-dependent on its thermodynamic conditions like temperature and pressure.

It is a variant that incorporates elements of the Prize Collecting Traveling Salesman Problem and Ridesharing into the PCV. The objective is to optimize the revenue of the driver, which selectively defines which delivery or collection tasks to perform along the route. The economic effect of the collection is modeled by a bonus. The model can be applied to the solution of hybrid routing systems with route tasks and solidary transport. The driver, while performing the selected tasks, can give rides to persons who share route costs with him. Passengers are protected by restrictions concerning the maximum value they agree to pay for a ride and maximum travel duration. The activity of collecting the bonus in each locality demands a specific amount of time, affects the route duration, and is interconnected with the embarkment of passengers. Two mathematical formulations are presented for the problem and validated by a computational experiment using a solver. We propose four heuristic algorithms three of them are hybrid metaheuristics. We tested the mathematical formulation implementations for 24 instances and the heuristic algorithms for 48.","Travelling salesman Problem, Travelling salesman Problem with profits, Ridesharing",en_US,Published,14,2019,2019-04-23 15:51:54,Brazil,Sao Leopoldo,-297.544.405,-511.516.497,452

The salesman is the driver of a capacitated vehicle and uses a ridesharing system to minimize travel costs. There are a penalty and a bonus associated with each vertex of a graph, G, that represents the problem. There is also a cost associated with each edge of G. The salesman must choose a subset of vertices to be visited so that the total bonus collection is at least a given a parameter. The length of the tour plus the sum of penalties of all vertices not visited is as small as possible. There is a set of persons demanding rides. The ride request consists of a pickup and a drop off location, a maximum travel duration, and the maximum amount the person agrees to pay. The driver shares the cost associated with each arc in the tour with the passengers in the vehicle. Constraints from ride requests, as well as the capacity of the car, must be satisfied. We present a mathematical formulation for the problem investigated in this study and solve it in an optimization tool. We also present three heuristics that hybridize exact and heuristic methods.

However, few comparative works exist that deal with TV shows. Since these shows are very popular, there are several Internet forums that suggest how similar some of them are, mostly by comparing roles or importance of core characters. Is this popular intuition backed by an objective, numerical analysis using tools from network theory? The goal of this paper is to compare four situation comedies (Seinfeld, Friends, How I Met Your Mother, and The Big Bang Theory) that share a lot in common since their characters are friends living in similar, urban, environments, struggling with their daily lives, careers, and so on. Using tools for analyzing social networks, these shows were compared, showing that their structures and the roles of the core characters are fundamentally different. The only measure that proved to be similar among the four shows is entropy of their graphs, especially when computed over the degree distribution.","Fictional characters social network, Centrality measures, Entropy in Networks, TV series",en_US,Published,15,2019,2019-11-20 12:38:49,Brazil,Pelotas,-317.699.736,-523.410.161,740

Therefore, we propose a new optimization method made for DenseNet, a convolutional neural network that has the characteristic of being completely connected. The objective of the method is to control the generation of the characteristic maps in relation to the moment the network is in, aiming to reduce the size of the network with the minimum of loss in accuracy. This control occurs reducing the number of feature maps through the addition of a new parameter called the Decrease Control or dc value, where the decrease occurs from half of the layers. In order to validate the behavior of the proposed model, experiments were performed using different image bases: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CALTECH-101, Cats vs Dogs and TinyImageNet.

In this context, this study proposes the application of a meta-heuristic inspired by herd immunity to the determination of the non-hierarchical grouping of objects, and compares the results obtained by this method with the answers provided by four other grouping strategies, described in the literature. In particular, the resulting arrangements of the classification of 33 benchmark collections, performed by the suggested algorithm, by the metaheuristic inspired by the particle swarm, by the genetic algorithm, by the K-means algorithm and by the meta-heuristic inspired by the thermal annealing process, were compared under the perspective of 10 different evaluation measures, indicating that the partitions established by the meta-heuristic inspired by the herd immunity may, in certain respects, be more favorable than the classifications obtained by the other clustering methods.","Data mining, heuristic, combinatorial optimization, bio-inspired computing",en_US,Published,8,2020,2020-09-05 11:23:49,Brazil,Sao Cristovao,-8.651.783,-481.171.083,672

108126,Rafael Galbieri,Instituto Mato-grossense do Algodão - IMAmt,Classification Based on Rules for the Study of Cotton Productivity in the State of Mato Grosso,"The advance of cotton farming in the Brazilian savannah boosted and made possible a highly technified, efficient and profitable production, elevating the country from the condition of cotton fiber importer in the 70s to one of the main exporters so far. Despite the increasing contribution of technologies such as transgenic cultivars, machines, inputs and more efficient data management, in recent years there has been a stagnation of cotton productivity in the State of Mato Grosso (MT). Data Mining (MD) techniques offer an excellent opportunity to assess this problem. Through the rules-based classification applied to a real database (BD) of cotton production in MT, factors were identified that were affecting and consequently limiting the increase in productivity. In the pre-processing of the data, we perform the attributes, selection, transformation and identification of outliers. Numerical attributes were discretized using automatic techniques: Kononenko (KO), Better Encoding (BE) and combination: KO + BE. In modeling the rule algorithms used were PART and JRip, both implemented in the WEKA tool. Performance was assessed using statistical metrics: accuracy, recall, cost and their combination using the I_FC index (created by the authors). Results showed better performance for the PART classifier, with discretization by the KO + BE technique, followed by binary conversion. The analysis of the rules made it possible to identify the attributes that most impact productivity.

We analyse Facebook's Institutional Pages and Twitter's Institutional Profiles. Supported by Pierre Bourdie's theory, we search for directions to identify and capture data related to sociability practices, i. e. actions performed such as Like, Comment and Share. The system of symbolic exchanges and mutual recognition treated by Pierre Bourdieu is represented and extracted automatically from these data in the form of generalized sequential patterns. In this format, the social interactions captured from each page are represented as sequences of actions. Next, we also use such data to measure the frequency of occurrence of each sequence. From such frequencies, we compute the effective mobilization capacity. Finally, the volume of BSC is computed based on the capacity of effective mobilization, the number of social interactions captured and the number of followers on each page. The results are aligned with Bourdieu's theory. The approach can be generalized to institutional pages or profiles in Online Social Networks.","Online Social Networks, Bourdieusian Social Capital, Sequential Patterns",en_US,Published,23,2020,2020-10-04 23:10:13,Brazil,Brasilia,-103.333.333,-53.2,700

However, to select good partners, the agent needs to deal with information about the abilities, experience, and goals of their partners. In this situation, the lack or inaccuracy of information may affect the agent's judgment about a given partner and hence, increases the risk to rely on an untrustworthy agent. Therefore, in this work, we present a trust model that combines different pieces of information, such as social image, reputation, and references to produce more precise information about the characteristics and abilities of agents. An important aspect of our trust model is that it can be easily configured to deal with different evaluation criteria. For instance, as presented in our experiments, the agents are able to select their partners by availability instead of the expertise level. Besides, the model allows the agents to decide when their own opinions about a partner are more relevant than the opinions received from third parties, and vice-versa.

110818,Gustavo Alberto Giménez Lugo,Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná – UTFPR,A Conceptual Model for Situating Purposes in Artificial Institutions,"{In multi-agent systems, artificial institutions connect institutional concepts, belonging to the institutional reality, to the concrete elements that compose the system. The institutional reality is composed of a set of institutional concepts, called Status-Functions. Current works on artificial institutions focus on identifying the status-functions and connecting them to the concrete elements. However, the functions associated with the status-functions are implicit. As a consequence, the agents cannot reason about the functions provided by the elements that carry the status-functions and, thus, cannot exploit these functions to satisfy their goals. Considering this problem, this paper proposes a model to express the functions -- or the purposes -- associated with the status-functions. Examples illustrate the application of the model in a practical scenario, showing how the agents can use purposes to reason about the satisfaction of their goals in institutional contexts.","purposes, status-functions, artificial institutions, multi-agent systems",en_US,Published,13,2021,2021-01-20 17:50:49,Brazil,Curitiba,-254.295.963,-492.712.724,233

To evaluate the approach, EEG data were collected from volunteers watching a sample of videos from the LIRIS-ACCEDE dataset. A total of 48 causal effects was statistically evaluated in order to check the causal impact of age, gender, and video content on liking and emotion.

116606,Tiago Fernandes Tavares,Universidade Estadual de Campinas - Unicamp,Exploring Supervised Techniques for Automated Recognition of Intention Classes from Portuguese Free Texts on Agriculture,"Technical and scientific knowledge is vast and complex, particularly in interdisciplinary fields such as sustainable agriculture, which is available in several interrelated, geographically dispersed and interdisciplinary online textual information sources. In this context, it is essential to support people with computational mechanisms that allow them to retrieve and interpret information in an appropriate way, as communication in these software systems is typically asynchronous and textual. User’s intention recognition and analysis in textual documents results in benefits for better information retrieval. However, intentions are expressed implicitly in texts in natural language and the specificities of the domain and cultural aspects of language make it difficult to process and analyze the text by computer systems.

These summaries are made by selecting sentences from the input data. The core of the problem is to find out how to choose these more relevant sentences in an appropriate manner. The proposed method uses a heuristic that makesdecisions according to the opinions found in the input text and to traits that a summary is expected to present. The evaluation is made by measuring three characteristics that contrastive summaries are expected to have: representativity (presence of opinions that are frequent in the input), contrastivity (presence of opinions that highlight differences between entities) and diversity (presence of different opinions to avoid redundancy). The novel method is compared to methods previously published and performs significantly better than them according to the measures used.

Thus, this paper presents the development of the application \textit{SegBee}, a computational tool that performs the segmentation in the apiary plates, where there is the presence of honey, in an accessible, fast and practical way. To do this, the OpenCV library was used for the digital image processing part, and the Kivy library was used to develop the interface of the mobile application. The tests performed showed that the images were adequately segmented by \textit{SegBee}, indicating where the honey is located on each analyzed plate. A visual comparison was made between results obtained by \textit{SegBee} and another commercial application, demonstrating the effectiveness of the developed tool.

Such load variation was used for the detection of failures of 1, 2, and 4 broken bars consecutively on the rotor and in the condition of 2 broken bars and 2 other broken bars diametrically opposite.

For represent an operation capable of being interpreted as a combinatorial optimization problem, which has as a criterion function to minimize the squared error associated with the established subdivision of items, it observe that the application of approximation algorithms to its resolution has been frequently performed. In this circumstance, this study proposes the  use of a metaheuristic inspired by the composition and decoration of internal environments to cluster analysis, and compares the results obtained by this method with the responses achieved by five other classification techniques. Particulary, a non-parametric statistical evaluation, which compared the subdivisions determined by the method suggested with the subsets established by the K-means clustering algorithm and by meta-heuristics inspired by biological behaviors and physical phenomena, indicated that the proposed strategy it obtned groupings equivalent or more congruent than those determined by the other partitioning methods.","Evolutive Computing, Metaheuristics, Combinatorial Optimization, Pattern Recognition",en_US,Published,15,2022,2022-06-16 22:23:14,Brazil,Fortaleza,-37.304.512,-385.217.989,14

Efficiency, availability, integrity, and confidentiality requirements are evaluated through analytical models and theoretical discussions. Among the obtained results, we highlight the following: (i) the platform with a voting-based consensus algorithm yields a more efficient system, but is more prone to service unavailability, than that of the platform deploying an intensive-compute consensus algorithm (ii) integrity and confidentiality requirements may be satisfactorily met regardless of the consensus type.

In this paper, Machine Learning (ML) was applied on three public databases containing AQ-10 test results for adults, adolescents, and children as well as other characteristics that could influence the diagnosis of ASD. Experiments were carried out on the databases to list which attributes would be truly relevant for the diagnosis of ASD using ML, which could be of great value for medical students or residents, and for physicians who are not specialists in ASD. The experiments have shown that it is possible to reduce the number of attributes to only 5 while maintaining an Accuracy above 0.9.

Thus, it is concluded that the proposed model is capable of classifying the samples in the proposed age groups and proved to be robust and solid in the tests.","Imaging processing, convolutional neural network, trabecular bone structure, mandible, cone beam tomography, osteoporosis",en_US,Published,10,2023,2023-02-05 20:39:34,Brazil,Cascavel,-249.554.996,-534.560.544,31
129990,Adair Santa Catarina,Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Paraná - UNIOESTE,Evaluation of the Relationship Between the Age of the Patient and the Mandibular Trabecular Bone Structure Through Dental Cone Beam Tomographic Images by Means of a Convolutional Neural Network," Osteoporosis is a systemic condition that affects bone mineral density in individuals, affecting mainly women and is diagnosed by DXA examination. The research used 137 cone beam tomography scans, from which 1389 mandibles samples from female patients and 633 from male patients were selected for CNN training, which is composed of 3 dense layers with 100 neurons each and Relu activation function, update of weights by the Adam algorithm, using MaxPooling in each convolution the dense layer uses 100 neurons, with the activation function. The neural network training accuracy was 98% for males and 94% for females, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) equal to 0.94 and 0.81 for the respective genders. The accuracy obtained in validating the CNN was 98% for males and 89% for females. In the supervised test, using 5 cuts from 10 exams of the test set of each sex approximately 100% accuracy was obtained for both sexes. Thus, it is concluded that the proposed model is capable of classifying the samples in the proposed age groups and proved to be robust and solid in the tests.","Imaging processing, convolutional neural network, trabecular bone structure, mandible, cone beam tomography, osteoporosis",en_US,Published,10,2023,2023-02-05 20:39:34,Brazil,Cascavel,-249.554.996,-534.560.544,31
